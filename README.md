# histogramotron
Javascript based web-app to plot Loughborough University results files as histograms. Of limited use to those not at LU. Takes the standard LUSI marks CSV files and produces histograms of each assessment with an optional overall histogram.

The code runs client-side.

Based on a vibe-coding exercise - part to see what is possible, part production of a teaching example.

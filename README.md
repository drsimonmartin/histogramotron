# histogramotron
Javascript based web-app to plot Loughborough University results files as histograms. Of limited use to those not at LU. Takes the standard LUSI marks CSV files and produces histograms of each assessment with an optional overall histogram.

The code runs client-side.

Based on a vibe-coding exercise - part to see what is possible, part production of a teaching example.

## Use
1. open the html file (appears to work in Safari and Chrome)
2. Drag and Drop the CSV file into the file area at the top of the page
3. There is a switch to change the auto-binning to fixed bin size of 10%
4. Overall results are calculated from the data and the weightings in the LUSI header
